# K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

This repository explores both Regression and Classification models using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. It features a Streamlit interface that allows users to choose between models and input parameters for predictions.

## About
This project demonstrates the versatility of the KNN algorithm by implementing:

- **Regression**: Predicting salaries based on features from the [Salary Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/salaly-prediction-for-beginer).
- **Classification**: Classifying diabetes presence using the [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset) based on patient metrics.

With an interactive Streamlit app, users can seamlessly switch between regression and classification models in the sidebar and input their data for predictions.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose between regression (Salary Prediction) and classification (Diabetes Classification) models.
- **Parameter Input**: Provide feature values directly in the UI for live predictions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Real-time predictions and performance visualizations for selected models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
